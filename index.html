    <h1>Home health aides pushed for a big raise in New York State. Here's why they need it.</h1>
    <p class ='byline'>by Lara Heard</p>
    <p>
        In Spring 2022, a group of home health care workers pushed Albany to adopt a measure in the state budget that would increase the profession's minimum wage by 50%. The movement, which drew its demands from the proposed Fair Pay for Home Care Act, had mixed success. In April, the 2023 budget gave home health aides a raise of three dollars an hour, to be added gradually over the coming two years.  
    </p>
    <p>
        In an <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-historic-20-billion-multi-year-healthcare-investment-fy-2023-budget">announcement</a> from the governer's office, Kathy Hochul called the total $20 billion that the budget allocated to healthcare "historic investments that will rebuild the health care economy." She also gave a nod to health care employees, who she said were "asked to do the impossible" throughout COVID-19. 
    </p>
    <p>But in a profession that's historically been underpaid, a three dollar raise won't keep home health aide workers from struggling to make ends meet.</p>

        Around the country, wages have been low, despite a nationwide shortage of home health care workers. In February 2022, the pandemic <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/03/health/home-health-care-aide-shortage-khn-partner-wellness/index.html"> exacerbated</a> this shortage as home care workers left the job for positions in the industry that compensated them more generously. The job became more demanding, and necessitated that home care workers expose themselves to potential infection. </p>
        <p> PHI National reports that home care workers will be in higher demand in the coming years, when the number of people over 65 in the U.S. will increase. The organization says that the profession's membership grew by about 50% between 2010 and 2020. 
    </p>
        <p>
           Despite rising demand, the profession has not adequately paid its employees. In 2019, PHI National <a href="https://www.phinational.org/news/new-research-shows-home-care-workers-earn-11-hour-high-poverty/">reported</a> that about 17% had income that placed them below the poverty line. Below, explore the average wages for home health and care aides in the metropolitan areas where they are most prevalent. Data is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for May 2021.
